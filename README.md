## Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Run `npm start` to start the app in development mode.

Run `npm test` to run tests.

### Troubleshooting

If you have issues running tests or getting the app to start, consult the CRA troubleshooting docs here https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/docusaurus/docs/troubleshooting.md. Needing to install watchman with `brew install watchman` is a commonly needed fix to get Jest running.

If there's a problem with the build, the map is not rendering, or tests are failing out of the box, **it is not a "gotcha"**. Please reach out to let us know ðŸ’–
