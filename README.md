## Map Design Engineering Challenge

## Assignment

We'd like you to build a point-of-interest (POI) favoriting system. We want users to be able to click on a POI to add it to a UI of favorite places, and to display that list with a little information about what that place is, like a name and type. The user should be able to move the map from favorite to favorite by clicking items in the list. The user should also be able to unfavorite an item by clicking a button in the favorites list.

We'd like you to build the following features:

- Add a POI to an interface of favorites by clicking on a map POI
- Move the map from favorite to favorite by clicking through your favorites UI
- Unfavorite POIs

We'd also like a small write-up that explains any decisions and tradeoffs you made. If you struggled, let us know what you tried, what you experienced, and â€” if applicable â€” how you overcame. If you included any dependencies, spend some time talking about why you chose them, and crucially, what the downsides are of including them. What were some of the things you wish you were able to do? What were some of the things you tried that didn't work out? Written communication is important at Mapbox, and this portion of the challenge is evaluated on par with your code & tests.

### What we're looking for

- Your solutions should be extensible and re-usable
- Your code should be well tested, including the relationship between map and UI
- Your code should be tidy and adhere to conventions
- While a perfect design is not necessary, you should create a pleasant, usable experience
- Your write-up should be thoughtful and coherent prose. We want to hear your voice come through!

## Dependencies

**Node 14 or later**

## Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Run `npm start` to start the app in development mode.

Run `npm test` to run tests.

### Troubleshooting

If you have issues running tests or getting the app to start, consult the CRA troubleshooting docs here https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/docusaurus/docs/troubleshooting.md. Needing to install watchman with `brew install watchman` is a commonly needed fix to get Jest running.

If there's a problem with the build, the map is not rendering, or tests are failing out of the box, **it is not a "gotcha"**. Please reach out to let us know ðŸ’–
